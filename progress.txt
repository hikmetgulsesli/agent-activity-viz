Task: Create Agent Activity Visualizer - a real-time WebSocket-based dashboard
Started: 2026-02-12T05:22:00+03:00

## Codebase Patterns
- Project uses ES modules ("type": "module" in package.json)
- TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Node.js built-in test runner (node:test) for tests
- React 18 with JSX transform (react-jsx)
- WebSocket server using 'ws' library
- Vite for client bundling and dev server

## 2026-02-12 05:25 - US-001: Initialize project structure with Node.js + TypeScript
- Created project directory structure at /home/setrox/.openclaw/agent-activity-viz
- Initialized package.json with all required dependencies:
  - Runtime: ws, react, react-dom
  - Dev: @types/ws, @types/react, @types/react-dom, typescript, vite, concurrently
- Set up tsconfig.json with ES2022 target, ESNext modules, strict mode, react-jsx
- Created folder structure: src/server/, src/client/, dist/
- Created initial source files:
  - src/server/index.ts - WebSocket server entry point
  - src/client/main.tsx - React entry point
  - src/client/App.tsx - Root React component
- Added vite.config.ts for build configuration
- Added index.html as client entry point
- Created comprehensive setup tests in src/__tests__/setup.test.ts
- All 16 tests pass
- Typecheck passes
- Commit: bc0cf33

**Learnings:**
- Using `import type React from 'react'` doesn't work with JSX when React is used as a value (React.StrictMode)
- Need to use `import React from 'react'` and give React a type annotation to avoid unused import errors
- Node.js built-in test runner works well for project setup validation
